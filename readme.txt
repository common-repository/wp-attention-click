It allows to draw the attention of visitors in various ways

== Description ==
**WP Attention Click** is a plugin that is focused on *capture the attention of the visitor of your page* before they leave him.

The average number of visits at a global level is one 8 seconds, then this visit closes your website or another website goes. That the plugin does is for that visit to take one more action on your website before leaving.

------------

For this **WP Attention Click**  uses 2 methods currently:

- #### Bar
It shows in the upper part of the page a bar where you can call the attention of the visitor, with the personalized button you can have them click in order to have an attention. A very used case is to increase social networks like Facebook, Instagram, etc...

- #### Popup
A picture appears on the content, this box makes the visitor read quickly what it is about to be able to read and click on the attention button. A widely used case has been used to promote a book or sell something.

Both options have very similar but separate characteristics to be able to have different objectives, as both the Bar and the Popup have their options separately.
